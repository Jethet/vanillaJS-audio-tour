**Goal**  

The goal of this project is to build an open source app for geolocated audio-tours. The app will be used by a non-profit in Scotland but the code is available to anyone who wants to build/improve the app. It is a project created by students and junior developers who found each other through [codebar.io](https://www.codebar.io/).

**Description**  

Geolocation (also known as geotracking, geolocalization, or geopositioning) is the process of finding, determining and providing the exact location of a computer, networking device or equipment. It enables device location based on geographical coordinates and measurements. The coordinates are identified on a map to provide a complete address that usually includes a country, city, town/colony, building name and street address. Positions can also be expressed as a bearing and range from a known landmark. 

In this project, geolocation is used to make audio-tours for canal excursions. Our client wants the app to provide their guests with historical and other local information during their canal tours, preferably also in other languages for their foreign visitors. The app should have a database for images, audio files and other content. Other requirements include off-line operation of the app.


In the initial phase, the app will be built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We will also be using HTML5 audio player, and possibly video.

**MPV** PLEASE ADD OR DELETE, I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APP IS GOING TO BE  

In the initial phase, the app will be built to include the following functionality:
* the user will see a welcome page when opening the app
* the user can log in with either an access code or QR code
* the user enters a screen with access to the tours after accessing the app
* the user can select their audio tour by clicking on the screen
* the user can choose their preferred language from a drop-down menu
* after the selection, the user sees a confirmation on the screen and can start the audio tour by clicking the start button


* .... ?

**Backlog**  PLEASE ADD OR DELETE

Possible options to consider are:
* the user can stop the audio tour and return to the home screen
* add functionality to star places as favourites
* add functionality to save a map of the tour
* .... ?

**Technology used**

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript

**Deployment**

The app is deployed on Heroku (WE CAN ADD THE LINK TO THE MAIN DEPLOYMENT HERE IF WE LIKE)
