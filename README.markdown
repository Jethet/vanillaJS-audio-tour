# Audio Tour Demo

A project for creating geolocated audio-tours.

**Instructions**

Run npm install and then run npm start to start the project. For full testing it needs to be deployed on a public server and the webpaged accessed with a smartphone.

The goal of this project is to build an open source app for geolocated audio-tours. The app will be used by a non-profit in Scotland but the code is available to anyone who wants to build/improve the app. It is a project created by students and junior developers who found each other through [codebar.io](https://www.codebar.io/).

Geolocation (also known as geotracking, geolocalization, or geopositioning) is the process of finding, determining and providing the exact location of a computer, networking device or equipment. It enables device location based on geographical coordinates and measurements. The coordinates are identified on a map to provide a complete address that usually includes a country, city, town/colony, building name and street address. Positions can also be expressed as a bearing and range from a known landmark. In this project, geolocation is used to make audio-tours for canal excursions.

In the initial phase, the app will be built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We will also be using HTML5 audio and possibly video.
