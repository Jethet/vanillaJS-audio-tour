*under construction*

A project for creating geolocated audio-tours.                    <img src="/audio_tour.jpg" width="250"  />


**Instructions**

Run npm install and then run npm start to start the project. For full testing it needs to be deployed on a public server and the webpaged accessed with a smartphone.

**Goal**  

The goal of this project is to build an open source app for geolocated audio-tours. The app will be used by a non-profit in Scotland but the code is available to anyone who wants to build/improve the app. It is a project created by students and junior developers who found each other through [codebar.io](https://www.codebar.io/).

**Description**  

Geolocation (also known as geotracking, geolocalization, or geopositioning) is the process of finding, determining and providing the exact location of a computer, networking device or equipment. It enables device location based on geographical coordinates and measurements. The coordinates are identified on a map to provide a complete address that usually includes a country, city, town/colony, building name and street address. Positions can also be expressed as a bearing and range from a known landmark. In this project, geolocation is used to make audio-tours for canal excursions.  
WE NEED MORE EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE TOUR IS ABOUT HERE: IS IT FOLLOWING MONUMENTS, LANDMARKS? IS IT FOR A SPECIAL AUDIENCE (SCHOOL KIDS, ELDERLY, DISABLED PEOPLE)? IS IT FREE?

In the initial phase, the app will be built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We will also be using HTML5 audio player, and possibly video.

**MPV** PLEASE ADD OR DELETE, I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APP IS GOING TO BE  

In the initial phase, the app will be built to include the following functionality:
* the user can create an account
* the user can log in to their account
* the user can log out of their account
* the user can delete their account
* the user can choose their audio tour
* the user can start the audio tour
* the user can pause the audio tour
* the user can stop the audio tour and return to the home screen
* .... ?

**Backlog**  PLEASE ADD OR DELETE

In a later phase, possible options to consider are:
* add functionality to choose a language
* add functionality to star places as favourites
* add functionality to save a map of the tour
* .... ?

**Technology used**

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript

**Deployment**

The app is deployed on Heroku (WE CAN ADD THE LINK TO THE MAIN DEPLOYMENT HERE IF WE LIKE)
